ship of theseus,same numerical ship,"Discussion among sophisters of Athens regarding whether the 'Ship of Theseus' after all its planks were changed, was still the same ship as it was at the beginning. This debate arises due to the continuous restoration process involving replacement of old planks with new ones.",7f45be35c9a04e279f317f0c300392a7,4
ship custodian,same numerical ship,"If a person keeps all the decayed parts of 'Ship of Theseus' as they were taken out and uses them to build another ship, then that resulting ship would also be numerically the same as the original one.",7f45be35c9a04e279f317f0c300392a7,4
same numerical ship,two ships numerically the same,"If we have two ships which are exactly similar in terms of size, shape, and other attributes, then they would be numerically the same. However, in this context, it leads to an absurd situation.",7f45be35c9a04e279f317f0c300392a7,4

ship,matter,"In the context of discussing identity and sameness, the Ship is being analyzed in terms of its material composition. This shows a relationship between the concept of 'Ship' and 'Matter'.",52f2df3334f742f19a8b43d8a45c9c8c,4
the ship of theseus,numerically another ship,"The paradox presented by Hobbes illustrates that if no part of the material remains, it is considered as Numerically another Ship.

the ship of theseus,partly not the same,"In the context of discussing identity, if part of the material remains and part is changed, then the Ship will be partly the same and partly not the same.

two ships numerically the same,absurd,"Hobbes points out that it is absurd to consider two ships as numerically the same, given that every part of matter cannot be shared. This shows a negative relationship between 'Two Ships Numerically the same' and 'Absurd'.",52f2df3334f742f19a8b43d8a45c9c8c,4

ship,organisational structure,"According to a significant strand in cognitive science, the ship is considered as an organisational structure that has perceptual continuity rather than a collection of objectively existing thing parts.",eba2e248d8c742fcb1be0cfc0e397ed2,4
objective existence,human intuition,"Noam Chomsky argues that the assumption of objective existence in cognitive science is not an unassailable assumption from the perspective of the natural sciences, as human intuition is often mistaken.",eba2e248d8c742fcb1be0cfc0e397ed2,4
thought puzzle,extreme externalism,"According to other scientists, the thought puzzle arises due to extreme externalism, which assumes that what is true in our minds also holds true in the world.",eba2e248d8c742fcb1be0cfc0e397ed2,4
thought experiment,facts,"Following on from the observation that studying human confusion can reveal much about the brain's operation, but little about the nature of the external world, a significant strand in cognitive science would consider the ship not as a thing, nor even a collection of objectively existing thing parts, but rather as an organisational structure that has perceptual continuity.",eba2e248d8c742fcb1be0cfc0e397ed2,4
doctrine of quantifier variance,quantifier,"In the context provided, 'the doctrine of quantifier variance' and 'quantifier' are related because they both discuss the different uses and meanings of the existential quantifier in describing facts. This highlights the concept of ontological variability or quantifier variance, which suggests that there can be multiple equally natural and adequate interpretations for the same term.",a53ea0a3af3d4237bd1ca9d013e27cef,4
object,same house,"The context discusses the concept of an object staying the same even as its parts are replaced over time.

grandfather's axe,axe,"The context mentions an example known as the 'grandfather's axe', where an old axe has had both its head and handle replaced, leaving no original components.

trigger's broom,broom,"The context mentions another example known as 'Trigger's broom', where an old broom has had both its head and handle replaced, leaving no original components.
