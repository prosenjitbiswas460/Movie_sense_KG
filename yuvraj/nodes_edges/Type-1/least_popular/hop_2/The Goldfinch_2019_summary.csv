piece of fan art,enthusiasm,confusion,"The term 'piece of fan art' refers to a creative work produced by fans that shows their enthusiasm for a particular subject, which in this case is the book The Secret History by Donna Tartt. This enthusiasm can sometimes be indistinguishable from confusion, as suggested by the given context.","The term 'confusion' is often associated with the term 'enthusiasm', especially in situations where the enthusiasm seems misplaced or unclear, as implied by Peter Travers' description of the film adaptation of The Secret History as a 'botch job for the ages' that appears to be adapting the Cliff’s Notes version of the book instead of the book itself, producing an unplayable series of scene snippets."
