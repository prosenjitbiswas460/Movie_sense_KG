survival,humanity,"Miller described the film's key theme as survival, which he said it has in common with the American Westerns that were 'such a staple for the better part of a century in American cinema'. Survival and humanity are both key themes in Mad Max: Fury Road. The film explores the struggle to retain humanity in the face of apocalyptic events, as demonstrated by Max's journey from a haunted survivor to a hero committed to partnering with Furiosa to regain his own humanity."

furiosa,humanity,"Throughout Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa's character demonstrates the physicality of a hero committed to a rescue mission that 'sets up the start of a matriarchy as an antidote to the barbarian, warlike tribes that came before'. Her recovery of humanity is a central element of the film."
feminism,mad max: fury road,"Academic attention has been paid to feminism as another key theme in Mad Max: Fury Road. Charlize Theron's performance as Furiosa is the dramatic centre of the film, and her character's demonstration of physicality as a hero committed to a rescue mission contributes to this theme."
max,home,"Max's home was destroyed in the film, which adds to the key themes of survival and redemption."
