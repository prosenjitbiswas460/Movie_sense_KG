tony stark,thor,"In 'Avengers: Infinity War', both Tony Stark and Thor are Avengers trying to keep the Earth safe from a greater threat approaching in the form of Thanos. As the king of Asgard, Thor's storyline picks up after the events of Thor: Ragnarok where he is in a 'very profound' and 'very interesting place' with 'real emotional motivation'. The writers consulted with the director and screenwriter of Thor: Ragnarok to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film. Joe Russo revealed that Thor's storyline has 'the driving hero’s arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos’ argument'. If Thor had succeeded in killing Thanos, he would have been the main protagonist of the film."
