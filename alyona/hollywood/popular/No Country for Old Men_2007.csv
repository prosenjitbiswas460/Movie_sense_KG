Spoke to the multitude and the few alike."" This ideal is contrasted with the sense of things being out of alignment and harmony gone from the land and people in the context of the movie No Country for Old Men, as explained by Craig Kennedy.",d2af3021a3934f3d8e6fe9387ef08064,,,,4

chigurh,sheriff,"The Coen brothers weave together the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff at the beginning of the film, as the sheriff's voice accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial connection is further developed when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, as Chigurh had visited only minutes before and sat down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting. The Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in this spot. The sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. This mirroring goes beyond the level of reflection as Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both.",5b4f6a44d23a433bba5215fac7d988a8,,,,4
