mass scale mindlessness,race of 'achievement',"The authors believed the film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives and explores how threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children, while teachers should instead map their strengths and weaknesses. The pair wrote that Khan 'dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities'. This highlights how the film depicts how 'threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children' and suggests that teachers should instead map their strengths and weaknesses.
