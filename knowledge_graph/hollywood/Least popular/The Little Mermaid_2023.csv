wild unchartered waters,prince eric,"Menken revealed that the first of the four new songs, 'Wild Unchartered Waters', was written during the film's development for Prince Eric. Marshall wanted a new song for this moment of waves and all the wildness of what's out there in the ocean because Ariel represented that to Prince Eric; she being the girl who saved his life.

daughters of triton,ariel's sisters,"Two songs from the original film were cut: 'Daughters of Triton', sung by Ariel's sisters and 'Les Poissons', sung by the character of Eric's French cook Chef Louis. Menken explained the reasons for cutting the former, saying that it felt 'not needed' given the new approach the filmmakers gave to the sisters, and that they wanted the film to begin 'with a much more of a live-action feel of the ocean and meeting Ariel, and then we wait a little bit, make you wait until we get to 'Part of Your World.' And I think that was, you know, it was an amazing choice because it just builds the power and anticipation.'",b5443f3884074d7aa935eef6b759f00a,4
les poissons,eric's french cook chef louis,"Menken explained the reasons for cutting 'Les Poissons', sung by the character of Eric's French cook Chef Louis, who also was cut from the film. Marshall explained 'It's literally a Saturday morning cartoon section. If we had filmed it – I don't know how we would've filmed it – it never would have played. It's also a vacation from the story and has nothing to do with the story, so you can't do that in a live-action film.'",b5443f3884074d7aa935eef6b759f00a,4
