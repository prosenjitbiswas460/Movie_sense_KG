The scene in question involves Susan Atkins concluding that the Manson Family members should kill Dalton because he played a character who killed people on TV, as they believe he 'taught them to kill'. This comparison draws attention to those who criticise Tarantino for his use of fictional violence, implying they are hypocrites and complicit in real violence. By switching the real-life violence by Manson Family members with movie violence instead directed at them, David G. Hughes argues that 'Tarantino is making a firm distinction between cruel real-world violence and ethical, cathartic fantasy violence.'",a935fbd81cbc4747becb8379c985f1f9,4

This interpretation is supported by the fact that in the span of seconds, the fight goes from being viewed by dozens of people to absolutely no one, and the crowd just disappears which some believe shows the flashback to be a 'false memory'.
